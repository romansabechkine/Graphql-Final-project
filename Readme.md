## Project Description

### Backend: Apollo Server, SQLite db

**Functionalities:**

### Backend:
**User:** Creation, SignIn with a Session expiring in 600 minutes, SignOut, Delete <br />
**Article:** CRUD <br />
**Comment:** CRUD <br />
**Like:** Create, Delete <br />

### Frontend:
**User** Register, SignIn, SignOut <br />
**Article** Create article, read all articles <br />

Cons: 
1. The Frontend is not completely made: there are functionalities missing like: read, update, delete article. The same is relevant for comments and likes.
2. The frontend styling is completely missing.

Pros:
1. In my opinion the backend is made. 
2. The communication between front and back is working 


**Remark:** I was working alone in order to learn well the subject.
